# Earth-Engine-Scripts
GIS based analyses performed in Google Earth Engine

This repository contains two scripts. 
 
Both are to be used in the Google Earth Engine API. The first creates a map of a proposed relocation for the Treehouse Brewery and displays all of the criteria used in creating arriving at that decision. The next is based on a task of finding an appropriate neighborhood (at the census tract level) for a user. It outlines, critera such as proximity to schools, eliminates neighborhoods based upon specific demographics and distances (using buffers) from transit as well as educational institutions.
